//The idea is to merge the arrival and departure times of trains and consider them in sorted order. Maintain a counter to count the total number of trains present at the station at any point. The counter also represents the total number of platforms needed at that time.

//If the train is scheduled to arrive next, increase the counter by one and update the minimum platforms needed if the count is more than the minimum platforms needed so far.
//If the train is scheduled to depart next, decrease the counter by 1.
//One special case needs to be handled â€“ when two trains are scheduled to arrive and depart simultaneously, depart the train first.
